# eventbrite-unique

### problem
eventbrite has some cool events in their listings. 
but too often are the results littered with duplicates. 


### solution
this project aims to allow for the dedupping of results
and creating a unique result to make events easier to 
browse through. 

It does this through the use of TD-IDF vectoriztion.
