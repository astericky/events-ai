The most important relationship a man will have in his life is the relationship he has with himself. How he shows up in the world stems from that relationship. I experience great joy watching men grow and come to terms with who they are. This is not about figuring out who we are. It's about creating a vision of the best we can be and making that happen.\nCaptain Roloff\n\nWe are a part of an international men’s organization consisting of over 850 throughout North America and is open to any adult man who seeks to live a purposeful, passionate life and seeks to achieve new levels of personal success. Get an inside view here: http://www.legacymag.org/ Within North America, there are hundreds of men’s teams that consist of anywhere from 5 to 25 men per team. Teams usually meet weekly at men’s homes, places of business or public areas. Teams strive to provide an environment where men get to step out of their daily routine and get another perspective, unload any emotional or mental burdens, commit to success as they define it, and have fun in the process.\n\n• What to bring\nBring your \"A\" game\n\n• Important to know\nContact: Captain John Roloff 856-419-3372 johnr207@gmail.com","eventType":"PHYSICAL","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/phoenix-nation/events/305639867/","featuredEventPhoto":{"baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","highResUrl":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/d/6/highres_467905558.jpeg","id":"467905558","__typename":"PhotoInfo"},"feeSettings":null,"id":"305639867","isAttending":false,"isOnline":false,"isSaved":false,"covidPrecautions":{"venueType":null,"__typename":"CovidPrecautions"},"group":{"id":"23274997","isNewGroup":false,"isPrivate":false,"membershipMetadata":null,"keyGroupPhoto":{"baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","highResUrl":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/2/8/highres_488127176.jpeg","id":"488127176","__typename":"PhotoInfo"},"name":"Mens Team Meetup - Northern NJ - NY State","timezone":"America/New_York","urlname":"Phoenix-nation","__typename":"Group"},"maxTickets":50,"rsvps":{"totalCount":4,"__typename":"RsvpConnection"},"title":"Team \"So What\" weekly meeting Essex, Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, Morris Counties","venue":null,"socialLabels":[],"__typename":"Event","rsvpState":"JOIN_APPROVAL","series":{"events":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"305639867","dateTime":"2025-02-04T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"Phoenix-nation","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"305766726","dateTime":"2025-02-11T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"Phoenix-nation","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"305891233","dateTime":"2025-02-18T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"Phoenix-nation","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"fkjqwpyhcdbhc","dateTime":"2025-02-25T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"Phoenix-nation","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"fkjqwpyhcfbgb","dateTime":"2025-03-04T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"Phoenix-nation","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"}],"__typename":"SeriesEventConnection"},"__typename":"Series"}},"metadata":{"recId":"e735c497-708e-44d1-a052-d6e37119fc67","recSource":"ml-popular-events-nearby-offline","__typename":"SearchMetadata"},"__typename":"RecommendedEventsEdge"},{"node":{"dateTime":"2025-02-04T19:30:00-05:00","description":"2nd and 4th Tuesdays every month (7:30pm on Tuesdays)\n1st and 3rd Fridays every month (7pm on Fridays)\n\nPlease check schedule and [register here](https://www.urbansoulsyoga.com/energy-series-descriptions)\n\nOur transformational new Sound Bath experience, with Leigh Higgins and Brendan Gibbons, has been designed as a completely immersive self-care experience that assists in overall healing throughout the mind-body in all of its interconnectedness.\n\nPhysical: Sound vibrations stimulate the limbic system, forcing your muscles to relax and shifting us out of stress or anxiety modes by activating the PSNS/Vagus nerve. This stops the flow of stress hormones, and releases \"feel-good\" hormones, which lowers heart rate and blood pressure. Because the body is mostly water, it is a great conductor of sound! When these vibrations travel through the body, they promote healthy energy flow, circulation and overall rejuvenation.\n\nEmotional: By connecting us to our heart energy, a sound bath has the amazing ability to shift lower vibrational frequencies that can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, anger, fatigue, and depression—to healthier, higher frequencies that promote feelings of peace, love, and joy.\n\nMental: When we listen to sound, it helps us to disengage from thoughts and unhealthy mental patterns that sometimes become overwhelming. This sound bath was designed to assist in creating the mental space we need to achieve focus and clarity of thought, while allowing the mind to clear and reset.\n\nEnergetic: Sound healing facilitates the release of energetic blockages while promoting energy flow, bringing us back into ease, health, harmony and balance. It actually synchronizes your brainwaves to achieve profound states healing and relaxation!\n\nSpiritual: It is nothing short of profound... Sound healing elevates our sense of spiritual well-being by disconnecting from the thinking mind and tapping into the higher self. It allows us to open up and connect more deeply with ourselves. By setting an intention, we are able to receive messages/information about our lives, as well as what actions are in your highest good.\n\nPlease check the schedule at [here](https://www.urbansoulsyoga.com/book-yoga-class)\nSome months have 5 Tuesdays and the schedule may change to accommodate special events.\n\nPlease register and pay online before event to ensure a spot and confirm there have been no schedule changes.\n\n[Register here](https://www.urbansoulsyoga.com/energy-series-descriptions)\n\nPrice: $44","eventType":"PHYSICAL","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness/events/305639769/","featuredEventPhoto":{"baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","highResUrl":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/0/d/highres_497398125.jpeg","id":"497398125","__typename":"PhotoInfo"},"feeSettings":null,"id":"305639769","isAttending":false,"isOnline":false,"isSaved":false,"covidPrecautions":{"venueType":null,"__typename":"CovidPrecautions"},"group":{"id":"2945902","isNewGroup":false,"isPrivate":false,"membershipMetadata":null,"keyGroupPhoto":{"baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","highResUrl":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/highres_432311949.jpeg","id":"432311949","__typename":"PhotoInfo"},"name":"Sound, Breath and Shamanic Circles","timezone":"America/New_York","urlname":"sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness","__typename":"Group"},"maxTickets":0,"rsvps":{"totalCount":1,"__typename":"RsvpConnection"},"title":"Sound Bath","venue":{"id":"26438202","name":"Urban Souls Yoga","lat":40.737438,"lon":-74.030128,"city":"Hoboken","state":"nj","country":"us","__typename":"Venue"},"socialLabels":[],"__typename":"Event","rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN","series":{"events":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"305639769","dateTime":"2025-02-04T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"305891055","dateTime":"2025-02-18T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"tnpcjtyhcfbgb","dateTime":"2025-03-04T19:30:00-05:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"tnpcjtyhcfbxb","dateTime":"2025-03-18T19:30:00-04:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"},{"node":{"id":"tnpcjtyhcgbcb","dateTime":"2025-04-01T19:30:00-04:00","isAttending":false,"group":{"urlname":"sound-energy-shamanic-healing-meditation-mindfulness","__typename":"Group"},"__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventEdge"}],"__typename":"SeriesEventConnection"},"__typename":"Series"}},"metadata":{"recId":"e735c497-708e-44d1-a052-d6e37119fc67","recSource":"ml-popular-events-nearby-offline","__typename":"SearchMetadata"},"__typename":"RecommendedEventsEdge"},{"node":{"dateTime":"2025-02-04T19:30:00-05:00","description":"**The Urban Souls Energy Series was designed to keep your energy flowing and your mind-body feeling awesome!** Using deep breathwork techniques, healing sound frequencies and rhythmic, flowing movements, each experience will leave you buzzing!
